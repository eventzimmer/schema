`eventzimmer` is an event aggregation service that makes it possible to aggregate events from a multitude of services (such as iCalendar and Facebook).

The aggregated events can then be displayed via a frontend (as a list).

`schema` contains the code for the eventzimmer backend.

# Getting started

To get you a version of `schema` please have a look at the [install instructions](./SETUP.md).

# Architecture

`eventzimmer` consists of multiple parts that play together that are briefly covered in this section:

- an [API server](https://docs.eventzimmer.de) which stores events
- an aggregation tool which uses predefined sources to discover new events
- a [web frontend](https://eventzimmer.de), which can list the events from the API server.

The application process of eventzimmer is illustrated below:

For an introduction into the individual services, please have a look at their respective GitHub repositories.
